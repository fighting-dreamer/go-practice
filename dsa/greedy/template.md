Problem Type :

1. Segment :
   1. Interval :
      1. finding the max overlapping intervals at some value : 
         1. problem : minimum_platforms
         2. here we are trying to find the max number of intervals that are overlapping at a any point in time.
         3. here we can re-use the platform again, else there can be cases where it is one time use OR x time use.
      2. finding max-(non-overlapping) intervals across axis :
         1. problem : scheduling meetings given just one room, max trains that can run without overlapping
         2. here we are trying to say for each overlapped intervals, we choose only one of them to schedule for meeting.
      3. Merge overlapping intervals
      4. Insert interval
      5.
