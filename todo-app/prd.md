## TODO App

1. We have a service deployed, a user can enable a user with login and a user api-key(S) to update list.
2. we enable user to create CRUD on "list". each list have "task" (crud on tasks)
3. user can add one line entry for task. the app gives it a numeric id that auto increments
4. task is currently having status : "todo", "in-progress", "completed"
5. make it possible to run the same using local-cli only and if and when server is up and running, we can route the tasks or commands to it.

Other features :

2. add labels to tasks and be able to group them based on that, it can be multiple labels on same task
3. add label on list level.
4. have control on operations using certain api key on quite granular level.
5. add a due date and time, add a complete by time
6. clone list and clone tasks to other list
