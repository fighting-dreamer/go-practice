dp : 

1. you need to know the base cases
2. you need to know he variables and how they change (incrementing or smthing else
3. you can run the loop inside or outside, only thing is if the formula expect to use values of previous indices or values form previous indices, then the loop should be from small to higher. example in knapsack : wt 0 to W, index 0 to n
