Sorting by end time of the interval for the merge interval coding problem is not as effective as sorting by starting time, although it's possible to implement a solution with this approach. However, it would generally complicate the algorithm and make it less efficient. Here are some reasons why sorting by end time is less optimal:

1. **Difficulty in Identifying Overlapping Intervals**: Sorting by end time doesn't provide a straightforward way to identify overlapping intervals. It would require additional checks and comparisons to determine if two intervals overlap, which could increase the complexity of the algorithm.

2. **Potential for Incorrect Merging**: When sorting by end time, it becomes more challenging to accurately merge intervals because you have to consider whether the end time of one interval overlaps with the start time of the next interval. This could lead to incorrect merging or missed opportunities to merge intervals.

3. **Suboptimal Time Complexity**: Sorting by end time would likely lead to a less efficient algorithm overall. While it's possible to still achieve a solution, it may require nested loops or additional data structures to track overlapping intervals, resulting in suboptimal time complexity compared to sorting by starting time.

4. **Increased Complexity and Readability**: Sorting by end time could make the algorithm more complex and harder to understand. The logic for identifying overlapping intervals and merging them would be less intuitive compared to sorting by starting time.

Overall, while it's theoretically possible to solve the merge interval problem by sorting intervals based on their end times, sorting by starting time is the more commonly used and efficient approach. It leads to a more straightforward algorithm with better time complexity and readability.

Interval-related coding problems are commonly asked in coding interviews across various companies, especially those in the tech industry. These problems typically involve manipulating or analyzing a collection of intervals, such as merging overlapping intervals, finding overlapping intervals, or determining the maximum number of overlapping intervals, among others. Here are some examples of interval-related coding problems that are frequently asked in interviews:

1. **Merge Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals into one and return the resulting list of intervals.

2. **Insert Interval**: Given a set of non-overlapping intervals and a new interval, insert the new interval into the set of intervals, merging any overlapping intervals if necessary.

3. **Non-overlapping Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

4. **Meeting Rooms**: Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times, determine if a person could attend all meetings without overlapping.

5. **Meeting Rooms II**: Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times, find the minimum number of conference rooms required to hold all the meetings.

6. **Employee Free Time**: Given a list of employee's work schedules, find the free time slots when no employees have meetings.

7. **Maximum Number of Overlapping Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, find the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any point in time.

8. **Interval Intersection**: Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order. Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

9. **Find Right Interval**: Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i.

10. **Merge Overlapping Intervals in a Stream**: Implement a data structure to process a stream of intervals and merge overlapping intervals on the fly.

These are just a few examples of interval-related coding problems that can be encountered in interviews. Interviewers may also combine interval problems with other concepts such as sorting, dynamic programming, or data structures like heaps or trees to make the problem more challenging. It's essential to understand the principles behind interval manipulation and practice solving these types of problems to be well-prepared for coding interviews.

12. **Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**: Given an array of balloons where balloons[i] = [start, end], return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

13. **Employee Free Time II**: Given a list of employee's work schedules for each day of the week, find the common free time slots across all days.

14. **Range Module**: Implement a data structure to track a set of intervals, and support adding, removing, and querying for intervals.

15. **Interval List Intersections**: Given two lists of closed intervals, return the intersection of these two interval lists.

17. **My Calendar I/II/III**: Implement a calendar class to store and manage events. My Calendar I: Return true if the new event does not conflict with existing events. My Calendar II: Allow double booking. My Calendar III: Allow triple booking.

18. **Partition Labels**: Given a string S, partition S into as many parts as possible so that no two parts have characters from the same set. Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

19. **Find the Longest Overlapping Interval**: Given a collection of intervals, find the longest interval that overlaps with a specific interval.
